# Bowfolio App 

## Project Progress

### Week1: Self-learning

Week 1 is for the very fundamental iOS development tech stack.


### Week2: Self-development

In week 2, every member of the team will try to develop own version of bowfolio.
Here are the links of self-development repos:

Yuhan: https://github.com/yuhanj/bowfolio-yuhan

Tianhui: https://github.com/tianhuizhou/bowfolios-SwiftUI

Weirong: https://github.com/heweiron/myBowfolio

### Week3: Co-development

In week 3, we will work together to make the first deliverable.


## Developer Guide

First, install the latest version of XCode.

Second, clone the repo to your local computer. You can run the app by using either the XCode Simulator or an iPhone with the latest version.
(Caution: Using the camera function on a simulator will cause a crash.)
